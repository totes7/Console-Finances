# Console Finances

This JavaScript code is designed to perform comprehensive financial analysis on a given dataset. It calculates and provides key metrics to gain insights into the financial performance over a period of time. The app extracts information such as the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, the average of the changes in Profit/Losses (representing the overall trend), and identifies critical points by determining the greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses. For the latter, the app not only reports the amounts but also specifies the corresponding dates, offering a detailed understanding of the dataset's financial dynamics.
